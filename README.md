# Minkinator, another Discord bot.

## Requirements

* [Node v12.16 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* [DarkSky API key](https://darksky.net/dev)

## Setup

To get started, clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Litleck/Minkinator.git`.
After cloning run `npm install` in your terminal before starting the bot.
It can be difficult getting some packages such as [Sodium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium), [Canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas), and [SQLite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3). It's best to follow the guides for installing them on their npm pages as it varies between operating system.

You will also need a bot token and a DarkSky API key.

Create a file called `auth.json` in the `/src/config/`, and paste the tokens in their respective places.
**Do not** share these keys with anyone, it can be a severe vulnerability.

```json
{
  "discord": "botToken",
  "darkSky": "darkSkyToken"
}
```

To start the bot run `node .` inside of the `/src/` directory.
